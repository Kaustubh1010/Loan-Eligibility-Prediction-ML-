To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer's segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Tasks:

1) Find the predictors that are useful in predicting ‘Loan Status’. 
2) Draft the following classification models to predict whether a loan would be given or not: Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier. Also, write the inference of each model

Gender --------------> Male/ Female
